We are working in design mode. I want you to only work on the front end UI. You won't be connecting to the database at this point or any functionality.

Our goal is to create the UI for the @create.jsx  page. We must exactly matching the design provided here  @https://www.figma.com/design/PDlDrVa4jaDzzoCmwfmD4i/Aora---React-Native-Crash-Course-(Copy)?node-id=1-1309&t=MWi2F7voM6vG3QTR-4. The required attributed to create a video object is title (String), thumbnail (url), prompt (string), video (url) and creator (relationship with user collection). 

Let's use these packages - expo-image-picker and expo-video. @Expo Image Picker @Expo Video (expo-av) are the docs. Can you come up with an implementation plan? No code for now, let's focus on producing a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan. Feel free to add your thoughts to make this better. And ask me clarifying questions if anything is unclear.
